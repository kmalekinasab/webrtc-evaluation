I conducted experimental scenarios across multiple network environments, including LTE, LAN, Starlink, and Wi-Fi, by establishing WebRTC-based meetings between users.
During each session, I collected detailed WebRTC logs using dump files. These logs were then analyzed and visualized through the webrtc-figure.py script to evaluate performance metrics under different network conditions.
Additionally, the network_condition.sh script applies network emulation settings using tc, allowing precise control over parameters such as delay, packet loss, and bandwidth during experiments.
